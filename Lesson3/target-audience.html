            Our audience is quite a unique one, as our website is designed to bring people into the fold of Lovecraft fans,
             while also appealing to those who are already fans. By making an accurate, and useful website surrounding a topic everyone needs to know about, 
             we're able to reach more people, and be more appealing just by being so radically different from every other weather website you'd find out there on the web.
